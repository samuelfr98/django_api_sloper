# Sloper API
## Sloper's API acts as an ETL layer in the broader distributed architecture.
## INSERT SCREENSHOT OF DRAW.IO HERE 
## The ETL layer aggregates data across several sources, current yFinance and yFrake's free APIs. Sloper cross validates extracted information and simplifies the developer experience. Intuitive endpoints, simple response structures, and resilient consistency enable as frictionless experience - from development to end users alike.

## Sloper additionally provided data cacheing beyond simple web cached responses. With database backups of data, minimal functionality can be maintained even in extreme events of dependency downtime. This also increases response times for redundant responses. This increases performance, decreases costs, reduces risk of dependence on third parties, and enables data audits over time.

## Sloper enriches aggregated data beyond simply restructuring responses and performance. Sloper derives technical indicators to drive more advanced analysis.

## Most notably, Sloper serves in-house deep learning predictions for several use cases. LSTM models are tailored from scratch for a variety of forecasting tools, from trend analysis to predicting short term prices. These figures aim to enable critical thought and act as a starting point for predictive analysis. While Sloper brings advanced predictive technology to the everyday user with full transparency, these predictions are simply tools in a broader toolkit. The model is trained on the same data served by this API, and can be found at:
